Compile smallsh.c using the command below:

gcc smallsh.c -o smallsh

NOTE: 
I would recommand just running "p3testscript" by itself to test my smallsh if you want cleaner results. 
Running "p3testscript > mytestresults 2>&1" adds a lot of unnecessary "^@" symbols to the mytestresults file that may make it more difficult to read my smallsh's output results unless you open the file in full screen.
